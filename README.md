# win-10-services-toolbox

I use this repo to store the script files I use for my Win 10 ARM64 Optimised build over on XDA developers site.

The scripts used here can be used on any Windows arch (ARM/x86/x64) but will modify Services running and Registry entries
for some services.

Update-Service-Tool.bat - A little batch to start and stop win updates on the go, also has some safe to disable services because its 
pulled from my main project and is ongoing work in progress.

I will update with a list of what is disabled at a later date when I release my more feature full script.
